🛡️ Blue Team SOC Lab – Cybersecurity Detection & Monitoring
Overview

This repository showcases a hands-on Blue Team Security Operations Center (SOC) lab focused on threat detection, incident triage, and security monitoring using real-world tools and workflows. The lab simulates how SOC analysts investigate alerts, analyze logs, and document findings across multiple security domains.

The projects emphasize practical detection logic, signal focused dashboards, and clear documentation, rather than theoretical exercises.

🎯 Objectives

Simulate real-world SOC analyst workflows

Monitor and analyze security events using SIEM

Detect and investigate phishing activity

Monitor firewall and network security events

Practice incident triage, escalation, and documentation

Demonstrate Blue Team skills in a public, reviewable portfolio

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Splunk Enterprise (SIEM)

pfSense Firewall

SPL (Search Processing Language)

Syslog ingestion

Windows operating systems

GitHub for documentation and version control

📊 Dashboards & Visualizations

The lab includes multiple SOC-style dashboards such as:

Firewall events over time

Blocked traffic trends

Top blocked source IPs

Phishing attempts over time

Enforcement and activity summaries

Screenshots of dashboards and SPL searches are available in the screenshots/ folder.

📄 Documentation

Each project folder contains:

README.md – Project overview and objectives

spl-queries.md – Documented SPL searches used for detection and analysis

This mirrors professional SOC documentation practices and supports auditability and knowledge sharing.

🧠 SOC Skills Demonstrated

Security event monitoring

Incident triage and escalation

Log analysis and correlation

SIEM dashboard creation

Investigation documentation

Regulated-environment security mindset

🚀 Why This Lab Matters

This lab demonstrates hands-on cybersecurity experience aligned with entry level to mid-level SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Analyst roles. It focuses on how analysts think, investigate, and respond using imperfect real-world data rather, than scripted scenarios.
