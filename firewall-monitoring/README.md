# Firewall Threat Monitoring – Blue Team SOC Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates network-level threat monitoring using pfSense firewall logs ingested into Splunk SIEM. The goal is to identify blocked traffic, potential scanning activity, and abnormal connection behavior from a Blue Team SOC perspective.

## Objectives
- Monitor firewall allow and block actions
- Identify source IPs triggering firewall blocks
- Detect spikes in blocked traffic
- Support network-based threat investigation

## Tools Used
- pfSense Firewall
- Splunk Enterprise
- Syslog ingestion
- SPL (Search Processing Language)

## Data Source
Firewall logs were generated by pfSense and forwarded to Splunk via syslog. Events include:
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Firewall action (allow / block)
- Protocol and port information
- Timestamped network activity

## Dashboards
The following panels were created:
- Firewall Events Over Time
- Blocked Traffic Over Time
- Top Blocked Source IPs
- Firewall Action Distribution

## Detection Use Cases
- Network scanning detection
- Unauthorized connection attempts
- Baseline vs abnormal traffic behavior

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network security monitoring
- Firewall log analysis
- SIEM dashboard creation
- SPL-based investigation
- Blue Team threat detection

## Project Status
Completed – Portfolio Ready
